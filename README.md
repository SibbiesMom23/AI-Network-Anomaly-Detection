# AI-Based Network Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect anomalous network traffic using a Random Forest classifier. It was developed as part of my growing focus on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to cybersecurity and national security mission areas.

## 🔍 Overview

Cybersecurity analysts often need to detect unusual network behavior quickly. This project simulates common network traffic attributes and uses machine learning to classify whether a given traffic pattern is normal or anomalous. It showcases the intersection of cybersecurity and AI, including:

- Feature engineering for network data  
- Training a machine learning model  
- Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, and recall  
- Visualizing results with a confusion matrix  

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Generate synthetic network activity dataset**  
2. **Train a Random Forest classifier**  
3. **Predict anomalous vs. normal traffic**  
4. **Evaluate model performance**  
5. **Visualize confusion matrix results**
